This speaker profile serves as a template for new speakers.

The names "John Doe" or "John Roe" for men, "Jane Doe" or "Jane
Roe" for women, or "Johnnie Doe" and "Janie Doe" for children, or
just "Doe" non-gender-specifically are used as placeholder names
for a party whose true identity is unknown or must be withheld in
a legal action, case, or discussion.[1] The names are also used to
refer to a corpse or hospital patient whose identity is unknown.
This practice is widely used in the United States and Canada, but
is rarely used in other English-speaking countries including the
United Kingdom, whence the use of "John Doe" in a legal context
originates. The names "Joe Bloggs" or "John Smith" are used in the
UK as placeholder names, (mainly to mean 'any old person', the
classic 'Everyman')[citation needed] as well as in Australia and
New Zealand.[citation needed]
