The names "John Doe" or "John Roe" for men, "Jane Doe" or "Jane Roe" for women, or "Johnnie Doe" and "Janie Doe" for children, or just "Doe" non-gender-specifically are used as placeholder names for a party whose true identity is unknown or must be withheld in a legal action, case, or discussion.[1] The names are also used to refer to a corpse or hospital patient whose identity is unknown. This practice is widely used in the United States and Canada, but is rarely used in other English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom, whence the use of "John Doe" in a legal context originates. The names "Joe Bloggs" or "John Smith" are used in the UK as placeholder names, (mainly to mean 'any old person', the classic 'Everyman')[citation needed] as well as in Australia and New Zealand.[citation needed]
