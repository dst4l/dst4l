## How to get around in general

There are two ways to transport yourself around in Copenhagen. By public transport or by bicycle.

* Travel planners
  * The official one is called [http://www.rejseplanen.dk/](http://www.rejseplanen.dk)
  * But Copenhagen is also pretty good covered by Google Maps.

* Public transport in Copenhagen consists of

    * Metro - two lines M1 and M2
      * most important is line M2 which connects to the airport
      * The metro operates 24/7
      * Btw. if you see a construction site in the city of Copenhagen it is probably related to the undergoing expansion of the Metro in Copenhagen.

    * S-tog (City train)
      * S-tog connects most of the major Copenhagen with train lines
      * Most important line is Line A and E that connects the Central Station (Hovedbanegården) and Nørreport with Lyngby (where DTU is located)

    * Busses
      * Copenhagen is connected with a vast network of Busses
      * Most important bus lines are 150S and 173E that brings you from the main hub Nørreport to DTU.

* Information about tickets and prices for public transportation
    * You can buy tickets on busses (cash) and in machines at the stations (cash/credit card)
    * But you may save money by checking out one of the many options available here:

## How to get to Copenhagen from the Airport
