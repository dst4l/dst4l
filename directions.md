## How to get around in general

There are two ways to transport yourself around in Copenhagen. By public transport or by bicycle.

* Travel planners
  * The official one is called [http://www.rejseplanen.dk/](http://www.rejseplanen.dk)
  * But Copenhagen is also pretty well covered by Google Maps.

* Public transport in Copenhagen consists of

    * Metro - two lines M1 and M2
      * most important is line M2 which connects to the airport
      * The metro operates 24/7
      * Btw. if you see a construction site in the city of Copenhagen it is probably related to the undergoing expansion of the Metro in Copenhagen.

    * S-tog (City train)
      * S-tog connects most of greater Copenhagen with train lines
      * Most important lines are Line A and Line E that connect the Central Station (Hovedbanegården) and Nørreport Station with Lyngby Station (where DTU is located)

    * Busses
      * Copenhagen is connected with a vast network of Busses
      * Most important bus lines are 150S and 173E that brings you from the main hub Nørreport to DTU.

* Information about tickets and prices for public transportation
    * You can buy tickets on busses (cash) and in machines at the stations (cash/credit card)
    * But you may save money by checking out one of the many options available here:

* Bicycles – if you want to transport yourself like the Danes you should travel by bicycle.
    * Many locals go the 15 km from Copenhagen to DTU every day.

## How to get to Copenhagen from the Airport

If you are going straight to DTU from the Airport catch the M2 to Nørreport and catch 150S or 173E from there to Rævehøjvej/DTU.
