Recent studies suggest that there will be a shortfall in the near future of skilled talent available to help take advantage of big data in organizations. Meanwhile, government initiatives have encouraged the research community to share their data more openly, raising new challenges for researchers. Librarians can assist in this new data driven environment.

Data Scientist Training for Librarians (DST4L) is an experimental program with the purpose of training librarians to respond to the growing data needs of their communities. In the program, librarians familiarize themselves with the research data lifecycle, hands-on, using the latest tools for extracting, wrangling, versioning, analyzing, and presenting data. By experiencing the research data lifecycle themselves, becoming data savvy and embracing the data science culture, librarians can begin to imagine how their services might be transformed.

In this session I will provide a brief background on how DST4L came to be and where it might be headed. I will also provide context to why it is helpful for librarians to have this hands-on experience.

Christopher Erdmann will also be available to facilitate the DST4L 2016 workshop days.
