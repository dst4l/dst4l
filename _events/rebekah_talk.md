This talk will offer a critical perspective on some of the most common techniques used to collect data from the internet and social media platforms--with particular concern for how these techniques potentially influence (i.e., bias) our analyses. While the talk will rely heavily on examples from Twitter, we will also consider how these same issues affect data collection from other platforms.
