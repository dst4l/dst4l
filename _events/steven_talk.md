Libraries are not just book archives. They are information intermediaries - places where people look up digital designs for 3D printing, combine Open Data sources to perform cognitive analytics, use video to bring the world to remote audiences, and work with automated manufacturing to reduce carbon emissions through local production. Data and Information are at the heart of the 21st Century Library and we'll explore what that means in this presentation.

Steven Adler will give this final informal keynote while workshop attendees have a glass of wine or a beer
