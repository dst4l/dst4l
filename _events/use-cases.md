Waiting for final confirmation - but we expect to have 3 use cases by scientist - working with data and dealing with new ways of searching, getting information and visualizing.


Henriette Roued-Cunliffe will present "The importance of open heritage data".

She will present the current discussion on open heritage data in relation to GLAM  institutions.
This includes 5 questions that can be used to analyze the extent of open heritage data and what it looks like for galleries,
libraries, archives and museums.
