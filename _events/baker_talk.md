In this session Thomas and James will introduce you to two different approaches to grappling with library data.

First, we will use the UNIX command line to count and mine tabular data.
Second, we will use OpenRefine to batch edit and normalise tabular data.

We will conclude by introducing you to a range of common challenges that come up when working with digital data and that can be solved buy building on the command line skills you have already learned.
The aim of the session is to get you from having some data and having no idea what you can do with it, to having some data and having an idea of where to start.
