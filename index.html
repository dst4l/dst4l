  <h2>DST4L Comes to Copenhagen, again</h2>


  The role of the librarian in the Digital Age is changing? How will the role evolve and what do librarians need to focus on if they want to be a part of and included in academic workflows in the future?

  <p><a href="http://www.dst4l.info">Data Scientist Training for Librarians</a> (DST4L) is an experimental course, started at the
  <a title="John G. Wolbach Library" href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/lib/">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
  Astrophysics John G. Wolbach Library</a> and the <a title="Harvard Library" href="http://library.harvard.edu/">Harvard Library</a>
  to train librarians to respond to the growing data needs of their communities.
  Data science techniques are becoming increasingly important to all fields of scholarship. In this hands-on course,
  librarians learn the latest tools for extracting, wrangling, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. By experiencing the research data
  lifecycle themselves, librarians develop the data savvy skills that can help transform the services they offer.
