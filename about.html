<h2>DST4L at DTU Library once more</h2>

Librarians have always been great at information management and organization.
Librarians are also outstanding communicators and have been trained in transforming user information needs into
strategies and resources for investigation and learning.
These are core skills in data science and there is a need to focus on the role of librarians in data science in the Danish Research and Academic Library sector /DFFU-sector.
The essential task of the data science professional is to transform raw, messy data into actionable knowledge that can be
used by decision makers. Data Science Training for Librarians (DST4L) is a three day symposium that addresses the challenges of data science head on.
DST4L is a hands-on introduction in ways to collect, clean, analyze, visualize and importantly share data.
International teachers and speakers are present to put the practical and political application of data science into
context and lead an open discussion into why data science is important for the evolving role of librarians.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.dst4l.info">Data Scientist Training for Librarians</a> (DST4L) is an experimental course, started at the
<a title="John G. Wolbach Library" href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/lib/">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics John G. Wolbach Library</a> and the <a title="Harvard Library" href="http://library.harvard.edu/">Harvard Library</a>
to train librarians to respond to the growing data needs of their communities.
Data science techniques are becoming increasingly important to all fields of scholarship. In this hands-on course,
librarians learn the latest tools for extracting, wrangling, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. By experiencing the research data
lifecycle themselves, librarians develop the data savvy skills that can help transform the services they offer.
